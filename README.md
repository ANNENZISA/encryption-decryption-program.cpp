# encryption-decryption-program.cpp
This is a simple C++ program that encrypts and decrypts text using a basic Caesar cipher algorithm. The user can choose a shift value to encrypt or decrypt the text.
This program prompts the user to enter text, choose a shift value, encrypts the text using the Caesar cipher, and then decrypts it. The Caesar cipher shifts each letter in the text by a fixed amount. 
Note that this is a basic example, and for more secure encryption, you may want to explore more sophisticated algorithms.
